# setup pipeline on jenkins
# configure webhook to gitlab
# create build/deploy sh files
# configure nginx server
# add subdomain to letsencrypt
# update sudo visudo to grant ability to restart service (see sudo visudo appdeploy)


# issues
# npm out of date on npm install -> upgrade version
# syncing config file not committed to repo -> create custom script to ssh into jenkins and move file
# files in tiles repo were not the same as on server 
# letsencrypt webroot -> add subdomain to list of all domains/subs, don't do standalone
